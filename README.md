### Sorting Algorithms
1. Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

2. Quick Sort
Quick Sort is an efficient, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

### Searching Algorithms
1. Binary Search
Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.

### Recursive Algorithms
1. Merge Sort
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.
